This repository is as simple HTML site to determine the rarity of NFT traits.

NFT, or (Non-fungible token) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.

It works much like bitcoin, but in theory, there's not a cap to an NFT's circulation with the creation of more, rarer traits.

This site will be used to calcualte and display the statistical percentage defining the rarity of a given NFT's trait(s).
